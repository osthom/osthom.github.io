			<h3>DataMule</h3> 
			<p>
				Data Mule is a website that a fellow Colby student and I made for the Colby Athletics 
				Department. It is a portal for student atheletes, coaches and trainers that allows them 
				to see their weekly workout statistics that are collected from a tool made by
				<a href="https://www.hawkindynamics.com/hd-force-plates" target="_blank">Hawkin Dynamics</a>
				called a force plate. It was built with Flask, MySQL, and Javascript. It was deployed in 
				Fall 2024 and is currently used by the Colby Athletics Department to monitor athlete training.

				<b>Online Set Cover Problem Research</b> In the summer 2024 I did
				research with Professor Max Bender at Colby College about dynamic pricing
				algorithms for the online set cover problem. We developed a
				categorization of priceability for the OSC problem and created an
				strongly competetive deterministic algorithm with respect to the
				frequency parameter. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15094" target="_blank">link to paper</a>
